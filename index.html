<h4 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h4><p>This paper investigates the techniques and challenges of digital forensics and cybercrime investigations. All harmful behavior which is directly or indirectly related to computer are called cybercrime [1]. Nowadays, most of the crime involves computer systems. Therefore, the demand for cybercrime investigations is going up. All crimes are a subject to an investigation. Cybercrimes are no exception. Incorporating results from research papers, webpages and open-source resources, this paper shows the meaning of cybercrime and it’s categories, moreover, it mentions about the techniques and challenges for the digital forensics and cybercrime investigations.</p>
<p>Keywords-cybercrime, crime, cyber investigation, investigation, digital forensics, static analysis, live analysis</p>
<h2 id="I-INTRODUCTION"><a href="#I-INTRODUCTION" class="headerlink" title="I. INTRODUCTION"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h2><p>Cybercrime has become one of the most significant threats to society. It has started to be mentioned like real life crimes all over the news. Moreover, with the advancment of computer systems and technologies and the integration of mobile phones and computer systems with society, most of the crimes can be concidered as a cybercrime. The reason is that, all harmful behaviour which is directly or indirectly related to computers are called cybercrime [1]. These cybercrimes can have serious impacts on several domains. The impacts can affect industries and society overall. Based on a research published by Ponemon Institute, median annualized cost of cybercrime is $$ 5.9$ million. The research is done on 50 largersized organizations in various sectors. For each organization the cost is within the range of $$ 1.5$ million and $$ 36.5$ million per year [2]. For the last five years, cyber bullying is one of the worst fears for a teenager under the age of eighteen [2]. Cyberbullying and other cybercrimes that targets humanbeings can lead to severe mental and physical health problems and even suicide [3].</p>
<p>Since most of the crimes like fraud, drug trafficking, terrorism, child exploitation and homicide usually involves computers nowadays, investigations are starting to heavily rely on digital evidence [4].</p>
<h2 id="II-CYBERCRIME"><a href="#II-CYBERCRIME" class="headerlink" title="II. CYBERCRIME"></a>II. CYBERCRIME</h2><h2 id="A-What-is-cybercrime"><a href="#A-What-is-cybercrime" class="headerlink" title="A. What is cybercrime?"></a>A. What is cybercrime?</h2><p>Wide range of criminal activities that are carried out using digital devices and computer networks are called cybercrime [5]. Activities like, identity theft, fraud, data breaches, computer viruses, scams, exploiting vulnerabilities in order to get unauthorized access in a system, stealing information, service disrupting, cyberbullying, cyberdefemation and many other that harms individuals and organizations are counted as cybercrime. These examples can be categorized under four titles: Data crime, Network Crime, Access Crime and Related Crime [2].</p>
<h2 id="B-Categories-of-Cybercrime"><a href="#B-Categories-of-Cybercrime" class="headerlink" title="B. Categories of Cybercrime"></a>B. Categories of Cybercrime</h2><ol>
<li>Data Crime</li>
</ol>
<p>Intercepting, modifying and stealing of any kind of flowing data can be listed under this category. One of the most well-known attack, the Man-In-The-Middle cyberattack can be given an example for this category.</p>
<h2 id="2-Network-Crime"><a href="#2-Network-Crime" class="headerlink" title="2) Network Crime"></a>2) Network Crime</h2><p>Disrupting any network by inputting, deleting, surpressing, deteriorating, damaging or altering network data can be counted as a network crime. Denial of Service attacks, Spoofing, ARP-Poisoning, Sniffing attacks are common attack vectors that are being used against networks.</p>
<h2 id="3-Access-Crime"><a href="#3-Access-Crime" class="headerlink" title="3) Access Crime"></a>3) Access Crime</h2><p>Any attempts on gaining unauthorized access on a system or malicious software that is hidden in another software like Macros, Trojans, Spywears can be considered as an access crime. An attacker may try BruteForcing into a system or SQL-Injection vector can be utilized in order to get past the authorization of the system.</p>
<h2 id="4-Related-Crime"><a href="#4-Related-Crime" class="headerlink" title="4) Related Crime"></a>4) Related Crime</h2><p>This category stresses more on real-life related crimes. Aiding and abetting cybercrimes like hosting a website which allows drug or arms trafficking, or contentrelated cybercrimes like doxing, SWATing, cyberbullying, child-exploitation, cyberdefamation can be considered as related crimes.</p>
<h2 id="III-INVESTIGATING-CYBERCRIME-AND-DIGITAL-FORENSICS"><a href="#III-INVESTIGATING-CYBERCRIME-AND-DIGITAL-FORENSICS" class="headerlink" title="III. INVESTIGATING CYBERCRIME AND DIGITAL FORENSICS"></a>III. INVESTIGATING CYBERCRIME AND DIGITAL FORENSICS</h2><p>Crime investigation can be complicated and frustrating. Every crime has its own infrastructres, connections, people, gangs etc. Investigations can involve multiple fields like psychology, medicine, chemistry and the list can go on. Cybercrime is not not that different from real-life crimes. Internet is a vast collection of interconnected networks and each network contains its own infrastructres, technologies and resources. The enormous amount of access devices, services, various criminal behaviour and the tons of exploitable technology at hand, each situation is unique to itself [6]. Due to this fact, it becomes challenging to fit cybercriminal investigations into a standard task list approach that most of the law enforcments follow to investigate crimes. However, whenever the logical steps of cybercrime and investigative mindset are combined together, a logical model with key stages of cybercrime for investigation can be derived [7].</p>

<h2 id="IV-TECHNOLOGIES"><a href="#IV-TECHNOLOGIES" class="headerlink" title="IV. TECHNOLOGIES"></a>IV. TECHNOLOGIES</h2><p>There are technologies and tools that makes analysis and extracts information from machines and computers alike to support the investigations. There are two types of analysis. Static and Live analysis.</p>
<h2 id="A-Static-Analysis"><a href="#A-Static-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="A. Static Analysis"></a>A. Static Analysis</h2><p>Static analysis focuses on information from disk copies to extract files, deleted files, memory contents, web browsing history, connections, login history etc. [8]. This analysis gives an understanding of what kind of activites are being conducted within the computer. The data is being acquired from external devices like hard drives, USBs and CDs. For the data that is stored internally, memory dumping technique is used. To dump memory, tools like FTK Imager can be used.</p>
<p>However, static analysis has many shortcomings. There are multiple limiting factors that affects the ultimate result. Shutdown process, encrypted data, incomplete evidence, single snapshots can criticaly affect the final result. Shutting down the system includes many more shutting down processes. Closing all applications, terminating all services can alter, modify or delete data or files that may be crucial for the investigation. There may be scripts that can vipe vital data from the memory whenever it senses an investigation on the computer [9]. Encrypted data can be another challenge for the static analysis. If the investigated computer is usinng encrypted volumes or files, after shutdown, to access to memory, investigator needs a key to access to storage media, which is stored in the memory and not available after shutdown. Investigators may use snapshots to investigate the machine. Still, the snapshot must be selected very carefully to get the important data. If the selected snapshot is poorly selected, vital data may be lost.</p>
<p>Therefore, using static analysis can provide incomplete evidence. While it gives the complete image of the system before shutdown, it lacks to provide the systems dynamic state [10].</p>
<h2 id="B-Live-Analysis"><a href="#B-Live-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="B. Live Analysis"></a>B. Live Analysis</h2><p>The difference of the live analysis from the static analysis that, static analysis is conducted on devices that are turned off or not functional. In live analysis, information is gathered while the system is still functional. Live analysis can give better and clearer results than static analysis [8]. There are many approaches, using standard interface, imported utilites, modified system and additional hardware [11]</p>
<p>Investigators can use standard user interfaces, imported utilities, modified systems and additional hardware to investigate a crime on a functioning system. Standard user interfaces can be used to interact with the whole system.</p>
<p>Investigators can use UIs for monitoring and investigating the operating system. Command shells, secure shells and telent connections can be used. This method of approach is the simplest way to interact with the system. There is no need for additional hardware or software to extract and monitor the data. By simply interacting with the system, investigator can acquire, users, processes, open ports, scheduled tasks, and many more. However, using user interfaces has their own limitations and challenges. For example, an investigator may need proper level of access into a system. Which will lead to another process called privilege escalation. Using user interfaces poses a danger to system integrity as well. Usage of rootkits and other techniques may violate system integrity and most of the evidence can be altered or deleted.</p>
<p>Some hardware makes it possible to copy memory from a running sysyem into another external memory such as Hard drives and USBs. The overall point for additional hardware is to attach the external hardware to one of the system busses and initiating direct memory access. From direct memory access, the external hardware should transact the data from the compormised machine to an external memory. This method of approach most of the time needs a preinsallation. After the installation, the compormised operating system may react in a bad way. Some kernel level scripts may override and alter vital information about the system based on the detected hardware behaviour.</p>
<p>Overall, even if there are shortcomings of the mehtods of live analysis, it’s results are much more reliable in comparison to static analysis since, live analysis is conducted on dynamic and functional systems.</p>
<h2 id="C-Tools-for-Digital-Forensics-and-Analaysis"><a href="#C-Tools-for-Digital-Forensics-and-Analaysis" class="headerlink" title="C. Tools for Digital Forensics and Analaysis"></a>C. Tools for Digital Forensics and Analaysis</h2><p>In this section, some tools that are being used in realworld scenarios to conduct digital forensics and analaysis are mentioned. There are numerous amount of tools that are ready to serve depending on the situation. As it is mentioned in the paper, each cybercrime is unique to itself and it may need various tools to conduct an investigation on the compormised system. Depending on the requirements, investigator should chose the correct combinations of tools. Here, we understand the importance of the stages of cyber investigation. One needs to decide on what kind of data that is expected to be extracted, what kind of a system is the compromised system, what kind of access control there is on the system, what are the protective measures are activated and other requirements. Thus modelling the the overall approach and doing a risk assesment first, and then planning, selecting tools and taking action makes investigation goes smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>Below table depicts the popular tools in digital forensics, their main operating system and their mode of analysis.</p>

This involves developing<br>a practical system that mirrors the outlined evaluations, contributing to a deeper understanding<br>of the theoretical concepts and demonstrating the real-world applicability of Hybrid<br>Homomorphic Encryption. The focus is on bridging the gap between academic theory and<br>practical implementation, shedding light on potential challenges and optimizations in the<br>process.</p>

This has significant implications for privacy-preserving<br>cloud computing. However, HE is hindered by inefficiencies, making it mainly of interest<br>to the academic community. To tackle these challenges, researchers are exploring Hybrid<br>Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) as a potential solution.</p>
<h3 id="Hybrid-Homomorphic-Encryption"><a href="#Hybrid-Homomorphic-Encryption" class="headerlink" title="Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption"></a>Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption</h3><p>In a Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) scheme, a user encrypts local data with a<br>symmetric key (K) and encrypts K under HHE’s public key (pk), sending it to the cloud with<br>ciphertexts and an evaluation key (evk). The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) transforms<br>encrypted data into homomorphic ciphertexts, reducing computation costs for the client.<br>The work doesn’t propose a new HHE scheme but focuses on a detailed protocol to<br>showcase HHE’s practical applicability in real-world scenarios.</p>

</ul>
<p>As presented in the paper, the procedural framework comprises three distinctive modules:<br>SD.Setup, SD.Add, and SD.Query, each intricately linked with three principal entities—<br>Analyst, User, and CSP. In the present project, a judicious strategy has been adopted wherein<br>these entities are methodically instantiated as classes. This decision not only imparts a sense of<br>systematicity to the codebase but also furnishes an object-oriented manifestation of the<br>theoretical underpinnings. The orchestration of the simulation is tactically orchestrated through<br>the invocation of class methods within the main function. This structural alignment ensures a<br>coherent and programmatic emulation of the specified building blocks Turning these entities<br>into classes is a structured way to make the theoretical plan practical.</p>
<p>Class diagram:</p>
<ol>
<li><h3 id="SD-Setup"><a href="#SD-Setup" class="headerlink" title="SD.Setup"></a>SD.Setup</h3></li>
</ol>
<p>First, classes are constructed here. All three entities generates their RSA keys. Analyst<br>creates it’s own HE keys, CSP creates it’s own. User generates symmetric key. After the<br>construction of the classes are finished, analyst starts to build the message m1 with the<br>method “createFirstMessage”. Upon creation, CSP starts to process the message. In order<br>to reach evk key from the analyst, Evk key is so large to be able to encrypt. Due to this fact,<br>analyst encapsulates the evk key using AES and encrypts the key with th public key of CSP.<br>Finally sends them over to CSP. CSP has to decrypt the message and check it’s integrity.<br>This behaviour is implemented in the “processMessageFromAnalyst” method of CSP class.<br>If everything goes well CSP stores the evk key of analyst.<br>2. ### SD.Add<br>In this next step, the user puts together a message using the “sendMessageToCSP” method.<br>Here, the user encrypts its messages and a secret key, resulting in ci and ck. After doing<br>this, the user saves these values in a file and adds an extra layer of security by encrypting<br>the file using the AES algorithm. Once this is done, the user sends the message to the Cloud<br>Service Provider (CSP). The CSP then starts turning the encrypted message into a special<br>kind of encrypted message called homomorphic ciphertext. This transformation happens by<br>using the “decompression” method from the CSP class. The process showcases how the<br>user’s encrypted data is changed into a format that allows for secure computation by the<br>CSP, making the communication secure and practical within the context of the project’s<br>goals.<br>3. ### SD.Query<br>In the project’s final stage, the analyst encrypts their input, keeping it secure, and then sends<br>it over to the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). The CSP, acting like a digital evaluator,<br>processes the encrypted input using the “evaluate” method, a crucial step in the Hybrid<br>Homomorphic Encryption system. This method allows the CSP to perform computations<br>on the encrypted data while maintaining its confidentiality. After this assessment, the<br>analyst decrypts the result, referred to as Cres, using the appropriate decryption key.</p>

<h2 id="Experimentation"><a href="#Experimentation" class="headerlink" title="Experimentation"></a>Experimentation</h2><p>The motivation driving this project is centered on the exploration of Hybrid Homomorphic<br>Encryption through practical experiments. The primary objective is to move beyond theoretical<br>comprehension and immerse ourselves in the real-world dynamics of this cryptographic<br>approach. A particular emphasis has been placed on analyzing the computational costs,<br>specifically how they fluctuate with changes in plaintext within user interactions.</p>

<h2 id="Results"><a href="#Results" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a>Results</h2><p>This scheme is working on only one user plaintext. The whole reason of this code is to show the<br>user how the scheme works and how much time it takes to complete a whole scheme with one<br>plaintext added by the user.<br>Below, we can observe the output of the whole scheme and their costs.<br>image here <br><br>According to the output of the program, we can see that the most costly building block is the<br>SD.Add. It took 17297 milliseconds. The reason being that HHE.Decomp is computationaly<br>expensive. It took 17010 milliseconds for CSP to operate HHE.Decomp. The second most costly<br>build block is SD.Setup. RSA key generations, signings and file readings makes this building<br>block the second most costly building block. The average of RSA key generation is 217.3<br>milliseconds. Generating HE secret key for CSP and a symmetric key for User took 0<br>milliseconds. However on the other hand, generating HE keys for analyst took 2099<br>milliseconds. In the constructor of the analyst four keys are being generated: a public key, a<br>private key, a relinearization key (evk) and a galois key. Due to this fact, it took more than the<br>other entities.</p>
